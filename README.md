R Shiny interface for browsing results from Differential expression results

===============

  This repository is defining a shiny server that allows to browse differential expression results produce by a pipeline that analysed single cell expression analysis in a specific framework relating to organoids with CripsR introduced mutation associated with Familial case of Alzheimer disease. The tool requires the results to be stored in a specific nested list structure within .rds files, which were produced by a snakemake pipeline that computed differential expression using both deseq2 and a modified wilcoxon test. The scripts used to produce such file is found in the Rscripts subfolder.
